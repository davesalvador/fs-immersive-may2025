// Create a car class that has a top speed property and a function that prints out that top speed property.
// Use this class to write a program that creates a car object and prints out its topspeed.
// Using the class that you created in the last task create a location property that starts at 0. Then create a drive() function that increases the location variable by 10 miles. Create a stop() function that prints out youâ€™re final location.
