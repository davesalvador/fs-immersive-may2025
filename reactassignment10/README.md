Create a new React component called ConditionalRenderer.
Implement a variable called isVisible and initialize it to true.
Render a <div> element with the text "Component is Visible" if isVisible is true.
Render a <div> element with the text "Component is Hidden" if isVisible is false.
Implement a button that toggles the visibility of the component when clicked.
Test your React app to verify that the component visibility toggles correctly.
